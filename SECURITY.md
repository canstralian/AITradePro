## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability
2. Email security details to: [security@yourcompany.com] (replace with actual email)
3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

### Environment Variables
- Set strong, unique JWT_SECRET in production
- Use secure database credentials
- Configure proper LOG_LEVEL for production
- Set secure SESSION_SECRET

### Database Security
- Use connection pooling with proper limits
- Enable database-level encryption
- Regular backups with encryption
- Principle of least privilege for database users

### Network Security
- Use HTTPS in production
- Configure proper firewall rules
- Use secure WebSocket connections (WSS)
- Consider using a reverse proxy (nginx, etc.)

### Monitoring
- Set up log aggregation and monitoring
- Configure alerts for suspicious activities
- Regular security audits and dependency updates
- Monitor for failed authentication attempts

### Regular Maintenance
- Keep dependencies updated
- Regular security audits using `npm audit`
- Code reviews for security issues
- Automated security testing in CI/CD
