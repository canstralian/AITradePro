## Feature Description

Implement backtesting and backtrading capabilities to enhance the AI-based trading platform. These functions should include:

1. **Backtesting**: Simulating trades using historical data with parameters such as trade frequency, entry/exit strategies, and historical performance metrics.

2. **Backtrading**: Executing strategies in virtual trading environments with mechanisms to mimic live trade conditions.

3. **Metrics Gathering**: Include clear logging and generation of key metrics (e.g., win/loss ratio, average return, max drawdown).

## Technical Considerations

- Language: Python
- Use secure and validated data imports (preferably from PostgreSQL sources).
- Ensure compatibility with existing AI/ML pipelines and React-based front-end integrations.

## Expected Outcome

Deliver a modular and well-documented API interface with comprehensive test coverage.

Considerations for scalability and minimal system overhead should be incorporated.
